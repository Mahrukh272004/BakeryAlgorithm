Detailed Description
1. Create a class to represent the lock, with methods to acquire and release the lock.
2. Define a data structure to represent the ticket, with fields for the ticket number and
a flag indicating whether the process or thread is currently in the critical section.
3. Implement a method for acquiring the lock that assigns a ticket number to the
process or thread and waits until its turn arrives. This can be done using a busy-wait
loop that repeatedly checks the ticket number of all other processes or threads and
waits until its own turn arrives.
4. Implement a method for releasing the lock that resets the ticket flag and signals the
next process or thread in the queue. This can be done by incrementing the ticket
number and notifying the next process or thread in the queue that it is now their
turn.
5. Use atomic operations such as compare-and-swap or test-and-set to ensure atomicity
and prevent race conditions while accessing the ticket data structure.
